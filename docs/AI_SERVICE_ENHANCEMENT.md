**Health Status Tracking**
- HEALTHY: Model operating normally
- DEGRADED: Performance issues detected
- FAILED: Model unavailable or consistently failing
- LOADING: Model initialization in progress

### 3. Fine-tuning Pipeline

**Automated Fine-tuning**
- Scheduled fine-tuning based on usage patterns
- Custom training data for Kenyan legal context
- Model-specific optimization parameters
- Background processing to avoid service interruption

**Training Data Management**

### 4. Response Caching

**Intelligent Caching Strategy**
- MD5-based cache keys for prompt uniqueness
- TTL-based cache expiration (1 hour default)
- Cache size management with LRU eviction
- Model-specific cache segregation

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling

**Comprehensive Exception Management**
- Custom AIServiceException with error codes
- Graceful degradation on model failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Architecture Components
